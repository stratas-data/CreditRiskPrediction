# Credit Risk Prediction

This repository demonstrates the use of resampling and ensemble machine learning to evaluate credit risk in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending scenarios.

Conclusions:

1. Oversampling has the best balanced accuracy score of 0.9936

2. Oversampling and Combination Sampling have the best recall score at 0.99

3. All resampling models have an equal geometric mean score at 0.99

4. Easy Ensemble has the best balanced accuracy score at 0.87

5. Easy Ensemble has the best recall score at 0.92

6. Easy Ensemble has the best geometric mean score at 0.87

7. The top three features are: Initial List Status, Outstanding Principal, and Revolving Balance.
